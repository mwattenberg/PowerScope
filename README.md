# SerialPlotPlus
Yet another serial plotting app focusing particularly on the needs of power electronics and control engineers.

# Motivation
There are many tools for plotting serial data publically available such as
- SerialPlot
- Serial Port Plotter
- SerialLab
- Adriuno serial plotter

Additionally, commercial products such as
- Saleae Logic (analog data)
- Electric UI
- MPLABÂ® Data Visualizer

However, these tools each lack a set of features that SerialPlotPlus tries to combine.

# Features
- Designed from the ground up for fast data visualization
  - Binary data format
  - ASCII format
  - GPU accelerated visualization based on ScottPlot
- Virtual channels derived from real-time data steams
- Data analysis
  - Min / Max / Top / Bottom
  - Std. deviation
- Cross platform based on .net 8
