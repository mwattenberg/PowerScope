# Motivation
There are many tools for plotting serial data publically available such as
- SerialPlot
- Serial Port Plotter
- SerialLab
- Adriuno serial plotter

Additionally, commercial products such as
- Saleae Logic (analog data)
- Electric UI
- MPLABÂ® Data Visualizer

However, these tools each lack a set of features that SerialPlotPlus tries to combine.
