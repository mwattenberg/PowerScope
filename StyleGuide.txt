Use these guide lines for code readably:
- No tenary operators.
- No null conditional operators.
- explicit if-else statements.
- Skip {} for single line if / else statements.
- Do not use LINQ when a foreach loop is more readable.
- Minimize use of Linq in general.
- Clear getter and setter methods.
- No expression bodied members.
- Avoid chaining method calls.
- Employ switch statements over multiple if-else-if statements.
- The code can be verbose for the sake of clarity and readability.
- Do not make the code overly defensive. If there are bugs, they should be fixed, not hidden.
- Naming conventions:
  - private fields: _camelCase
  - public fields / properties: PascalCase
  - local variables: camelCase
  - method parameters: camelCase
  - interfaces: IPascalCase
  - classes: PascalCase
  - methods: PascalCase
  - No var keyword, always explicitly declare types.
